## Usage

``` javascript

```

### phuzzy(collection, search[, pick])

Performs a "fuzzy" search on `collection` using `search` as the term. `collection` is a native JavaScript array, or a array-like object that supports `Array#filter`. `pick` is an optional function that can be used to determine which property of the collection's items to evaluate, in the case where the items aren't strings. `pick` can also be specified as a string, see example below. `collection` is never mutated.

Example:

``` js
var beatles = ['paul', 'john', 'ringo', 'george']
var goBeatles = phuzzy(beatles, 'go')
console.log(goBeatles) // [ 'ringo', 'george' ]
```

'george' is included even to there are characters between the 'g' and 'o', since the search is "fuzzy".

Example using `pick`:

``` js
var documents = [
  { text: 'Hello World' },
  { text: 'Hello Lucy' },
  { text: 'Hello Maria' }
]
var filtered = phuzzy(documents, 'maria' item => item.text)
console.log(filtered) // [ { text: 'Hello Maria' ]
```

In this example we could substitute `item => item.text` with `"text"`, using the property name shorthand:

``` js
var filtered = phuzzy(documents, 'maria' 'text')
console.log(filtered) // [ { text: 'Hello Maria' ]
```
